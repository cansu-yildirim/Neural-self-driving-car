## Neural Self-Driving Car Simulation (Vanilla JS)

**A fully browser-based, AI-powered self-driving car simulator built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS â€” no external libraries, frameworks, or engines involved.**

This project demonstrates the core concepts of artificial intelligence, neural networks, and evolutionary learning through an interactive 2D simulation. It features a fleet of AI-controlled cars that can perceive their surroundings using virtual sensors, make decisions via a custom-built neural network, and improve over time through an evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection.

### Features

- **Pure JavaScript implementation**: No external libraries or engines. Everythingâ€”from neural networks to ray-casting sensorsâ€”is built from scratch.
- **Feedforward Neural Network**: A lightweight, custom-built neural architecture governs each car's behavior.
- **Ray-Casting Sensors**: Simulate LIDAR-like sensor data for detecting road boundaries and obstacles.
- **Evolutionary Algorithm**: Cars learn through random mutation and selection of the best-performing network across generations.
- **Real-Time Neural Network Visualization**: A visual network graph updates live as the top-performing car makes decisions.
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Car Count
  - Max Speed
  - Mutation Rate
  - Difficulty Level (with persistent localStorage integration)
- **Persistent Learning**: Save and load the best-performing "brain" locally using your browserâ€™s LocalStorage API.
- **Modular File Structure**: Easy to read, extend, and contribute to.

### Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** â€“ Core logic, neural network, simulation, interaction
- **HTML5 Canvas API** â€“ Real-time rendering of the simulation and neural network
- **CSS3 (Flexbox Layout)** â€“ Responsive and structured UI layout
- **LocalStorage API** â€“ Persistent data storage across sessions

### Simulation Structure

- **Three-Panel Layout**:
  - **Left**: Settings & Difficulty Controls
  - **Center**: Road & Car Simulation (Canvas)
  - **Right**: Neural Network Visualizer
- **Controls**:
  - `Spacebar`: Reloads simulation with saved settings
  - `Save`: Stores the best brain to LocalStorage
  - `Discard`: Removes saved brain and resets AI
  - `Difficulty Dropdown`: Adjusts challenge level (auto reload)
